# wingify_rest

Problem Statement: Design a RESTful API for an online store which can be used to manage different products.
 

Details: You need to send us a design document on how you would implement a RESTful API for an online store. It should support addition, deletion, editing and searching a product. You are free to assume everything else but make sure you document them. Make sure you have considered things like authentication (only authenticated users can add / view / edit / delete items). You are creating the API for a mobile developer who will use it to create a mobile app. It would be great if you can also include some example scenarios along with the expected request / response objects.
 

This has to be done without having any framework in mind. You have to submit the design document for this API and the implementation in a backend language of your choice (node.js, PHP etc) with proper instructions to setup your code and test it.
